# 🌍 Public Health Disparities & COVID-19 Forecasting – A Data Journey

## 📌 Project Summary

Health isn't just about hospitals — it's about equity, investment, and timely access to life-saving interventions. This project uses real-world data from the **World Bank** and **Our World in Data (OWID)** to explore how countries vary in healthcare spending and vaccine rollout. Through data cleaning, analysis, and forecasting, we uncover global health inequalities and predict vaccination trends.

## 🧪 What This Project Covers

### 1. 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (ETL)
- Merged multiple sources (World Bank + OWID)
- Cleaned and standardized health expenditure and vaccination data
- Built a unified dataset ready for analysis

### 2. 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visual insights included:
- Health spending (% of GDP) by region and income group
- Vaccination rates over time across countries
- Correlation between national wealth and vaccine access

### 3. 🔮 Forecasting Vaccination Trends
Using **time-series modeling**, we projected vaccination coverage for coming years, identifying countries likely to fall behind or surge ahead.

## 📈 Key Findings

- 💰 **Wealth Drives Access**: High-income nations spend significantly more on healthcare and led faster vaccination efforts.
- ⏳ **Equity Gaps Exist**: Low- and middle-income countries show delayed progress, even after global support.
- 🧾 **Vaccination Plateaus Emerging**: Many nations are hitting saturation points, slowing down vaccination progress.
